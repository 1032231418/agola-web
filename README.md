# Agola Web UI

[![Build Status](https://run.agola.io/api/v1alpha/badges/org%2Fagola%2Fagola-web?branch=master)](https://run.agola.io/org/agola/projects/agola-web.proj)

This is the agola web ui repository. 

The agola web ui is built with [vue](https://vuejs.org) and [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com)

It's currently good for the initial release but we'll start an ui/ux redesign to make it better and add missing parts.
